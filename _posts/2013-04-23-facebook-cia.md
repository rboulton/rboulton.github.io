Take a look at the linked NDA (or as they call it "Confidential Information
Acknowledgement") from Facebook:
[UK_CIA.pdf](http://files.meetup.com/1715272/Facebook%20Site%20Visitor%20NDA.pdf)

In particular, note the following phrases:

1. "we consider any information you learn while you’re here, to be our
   confidential information."
2. "you will not use any confidential information you learn while you’re here
   for anything other than for the purpose of the visit"
3. "you will not share that confidential information with anyone else."

Now, I strongly dislike NDAs: I think they're a blunt instrument, mainly of use
for intimidation and to cause chilling effects, and that they replace mutual
trust with mutual suspicion which is a bad foundation for any relationship.
Putting that aside, this is probably an acceptable NDA if you're going to
Facebook's office for a business meeting, and I might sign it (with sadness) in
that context.

However, last year I was asked to sign this NDA when visiting Facebook's office
for an evening tech meetup on machine learning; the talk was later broadcast
publically on the internet (well, pretty publically; Facebook login required,
but no NDA required!).  I didn't sign, told the Facebook staff why, and was
required to leave the office and miss the meetup.  I'd hoped this NDA had been
dropped but hear that it's still being used.  And people are still signing it!

Let's look at what this NDA says:

1. First, it defines the phrase "confidential information" to mean "anything you
   learn while you're here".  No restrictions on this: literally "anything you
   learn".  This would include, in my case for example, some machine learning
   algorithm that's in an openly published paper that I just hadn't come across
   yet.  To the best of my knowledge, this is a legal document, and this is a
   clear definition of a term, so any further use of that term in the document
   is expected to follow that definition.

2. Next, it asks you to agree that you will not use "confidential information"
   for anything other than the purpose of the visit.  So, I'm not allowed to
   use that algorithm I've just learnt about, despite it being fully public
   knowledge.  *Unacceptable*.

3. Also, it asks you not to share that "confidential information" with anyone
   else.  So, I'm not allowed to tell anyone else about the existence of this
   public algorithm either.  *Ridiculous*.

It does not matter that a "common sense" reading of the agreement would assume
that the confidential information referred to in phrases (2) and (3) doesn't
include things which don't seem "confidential".  The document has clearly
defined what it means by "confidential".  Unless you feel like getting a lawyer
to analyse this agreement, and then feel ready to take it to court if
challenged, you should assume it means what it says, not what you'd like it to
say.

This is pretty sneaky, actually; the whole thing is dressed up not to sound
like a legal document, and buried in the middle of some friendly text saying
perfectly reasonable things, is an utterly unreasonable and outrageous trap.
Combine this with the pressure of expectation that you'll just sign a "simple
NDA", our natural desire not to want to be "difficult", and wanting to be
allowed to go to an interesting meetup, and its not surprising that most people
just sign it.

However, if I'd signed this NDA, I would not feel safe discussing anything I'd
learnt at the meetup with anyone else, or implementing any code or system based
on this.  Since that's what I do for a living, I wouldn't feel safe doing my
job any more.  There's no way I could sign it.

TL;DR:
======

Two principles I try to follow:

* Try to approach problems calmly and constructively.
* If you don't intend to follow the terms of a legal contract, you shouldn't sign it.

So, here's a plea:

* *Don't sign this or any bullshit NDA when visiting facebook's office for an
  open meetup.*
* *Make it very public that you're not attending because of the NDA.*

This is probably most effective if you sign up, turn up, and clearly and
publically refuse to sign.  They'll ask you to leave, with "regret", so be
ready to go to the pub with your like-minded friends and have a meetup there
instead.

Oh, and if any other large companies are trying this, read their NDAs very
carefully to ensure that you're happy to follow it before signing it, or better
yet, *publically and loudly (but politely) refuse to sign it and don't attend*.

Several people tell me I should just have signed this NDA and nothing would
have come of it; I agree that Facebook probably don't intend for it to have a
chilling effect on discussion of published algorithms, etc., but: *NO, NO, NO*

Rolling over and accepting things is why this kind of rubbish happens.  Let's
stamp it out before it spreads any further.
